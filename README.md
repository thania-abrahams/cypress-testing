## A Review of the Most Important Sections

<ul>
  <li>cypress/e2e/case-studies.cy</li>
  <li>package.json</li>
  <li>cypress.config.js</li>
</ul>

### cypress/e2e/case-studies.cy

We begin with an e2e test using the Cura Make An Appointment page, that takes you through various ui interactions to logging in and submitting a form
I then cover various common use cases such as tricky checkboxes, multiple checkboxes, how to specify viewports, how to create a viewport hybrid suite,

The package.json file has a list of additional plugins that I installed to have certain test suites run
The cypress.config

Test Suites for the following scenarios
